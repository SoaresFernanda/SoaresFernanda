### Hello, My name is Fernanda 
 My career in technology began in 2018, where I started a technical course in computer science in search of fulfilling my dream of changing my profession to the technology area in which I have always been passionate. During this period, I did some internships in user support and information security, but I always knew that my area of expertise would be development. 

I had my first opportunity as a developer in 2019 and since then, I continue on that path. I am majoring in Information System and have been a C# developer for 2 years. I am looking to improve myself in Microsoft technologies which has been my focus at the current moment. 

 My knowledge as a backend developer includes Typescript, C#, ASP.NET, classic ASP,.NET and other Microsoft jazz. On the frontend, HTML/CSS/Javascript and knowledge of frameworks like Angular. In mobile IONIC, REACT. Database is mostly SQL Server, but I have knowledge in MongoDB and Firebase. 
 
 But anyway, this is a little of what I've done so far in my professional career. I'm trying to improve my personal knowledge of technologies and support some community where I can be useful (NOTE: Do you know of any cool community? Send me tips ðŸ˜œ). My profile still has few projects so this will be my biggest personal effort. Below is some of what I built for learning purposes.
